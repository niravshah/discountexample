As discussed on the phone, we have a coding test we'd like you to complete
which forms the next stage of the interview process for Capita Employee
Benefits (Orbit).  This is a fork which has been created for you specifically,
please clone it locally via Git.  Make your changes, commit as often as you
need and then push it back to origin when you're happy it's complete.

## The Task ##

Below is the current, simple class model in the existing code.

![model](https://bitbucket.org/repo/RoKEXR/images/471713012-model.png)

You must implement the following requirements, adding or changing code as 
required:

 1. 10% off the total for orders totalling &pound;50 or more
 2. 3 items for the price of 2 when buying multiple items of the same product
 3. Discount Voucher

The requirements are deliberately vague in order to force you to make some
choices of your own.  Please make what assumptions you think are needed based
on your own experiences with shopping and discounts. If you wish you could
include a .txt file with details of any assumptions made, or leave comments in
the code.

Let your recruiter know when you&apos;ve finished and pushed back and we&apos;ll take a
look.  Happy coding :-)


### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone using the URL at the top of the bitbucket home page for this fork
* Open in your favourite IDE or text editor (we have included project files for gradle, Eclipse/STS and IntelliJ to speed this up)

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Use any tools and resources you like
* Hack code
* Commit/Push

### Anything else? ###

* We think a reasonable solution to this should take 2-4 hours in total.. there's no deadline, most people push something back within a few days
* Contact the recruiter with any issues and the right person will get back to you
